The inference process created SARS-CoV-2 events corresponding to each event in the SARS-CoV-1 pathway and populated those events with SARS-CoV-2 protein-containing physical entities based on orthology to SARS-CoV-1 proteins (https://reactome.org/documentation/inferred-events). All of these computationally created events and entities have been reviewed by Reactome curators and modified as appropriate where recently published experimental data indicate the existences of differences between the molecular details of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection pathways.<br><br>SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 infection begins with the binding of viral S (spike) protein to cell surface angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and endocytosis of the bound virion. Within the endocytic vesicle, host proteases mediate cleavage of S protein into S1 and S2 fragments, leading to S2\u2011mediated fusion of the viral and host endosome membranes and release of the viral capsid into the host cell cytosol. The capsid is uncoated to free the viral genomic RNA, whose cap\u2011dependent translation produces polyprotein pp1a and, by means of a 1\u2011base frameshift, polyprotein pp1ab. Autoproteolytic cleavage of pp1a and pp1ab generates 15 or 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) with various functions. Importantly, the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity is encoded in nsp12. Nsp3, 4, and 6 induce rearrangement of the cellular endoplasmic reticulum membrane to form cytosolic double membrane vesicles (DMVs) where the viral replication transcription complex is assembled and anchored. With viral genomic RNA as a template, viral replicase\u2011transcriptase synthesizes a full length negative sense antigenome, which in turn serves as a template for the synthesis of new genomic RNA. The replicase\u2011transcriptase can also switch template during discontinuous transcription of the genome at transcription regulated sequences to produce a nested set of negative\u2011sense subgenomic (sg) RNAs, which are used as templates for the synthesis of positive\u2011sense sgRNAs that are translated to generate viral proteins. Finally, viral particle assembly occurs in the ER Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). Viral M protein provides the scaffold for virion morphogenesis (Hartenian et al. 2020; Fung & Liu 2019; Masters 2006).<p>This Reactome module also describes molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 modulates innate and adaptive immune responses, autophagy, host translation, intracellular signaling and regulatory pathways, and PDZ-mediated cell-cell junctions, mostly annotated from studies of cells infected with SARS-CoV-2.", "isDisease": true}, {"dbId": "9705683", "stId": "R-HSA-9705683", "id": "R-HSA-9705683", "name": "SARS-CoV-2-host interactions", "exactType": "Pathway", "species": ["Homo sapiens"], "summation": "Coronaviruses are a group of enveloped viruses with single\u2011stranded, positive\u2011sense RNA genomes.

The viral replication and transcription are facilitated by virus-encoded non-structural proteins (SARS-CoV-2 nsp1\u2013nsp16) that assemble to form a DMV-bound replication-transcription complex (RTC) (V'kovski P et al. 2021). The replication strategy of CoVs can generate both single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) species, that may act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) recognized by pattern recognition receptor (PRR) such as toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR8, antiviral innate immune response receptor RIG-I (also known as DEAD box protein 58, DDX58) and interferon-induced helicase C domain-containing protein 1 (IFIH1, also known as MDA5) (Salvi V et al. 2021; Campbell GR et al. 2021; Rebendenne A et al. 2021). The activated PRRs trigger signaling pathways to produce type I and type III interferons IFNs and proinflammatory mediators that perform antiviral functions. This Reactome module describes the mechanisms underlying PRR-mediated sensing of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. First, endosomal recognition of viral ssRNA occurs by means of TLR7 and TLR8, which detect GU-rich ssRNA sequences (Salvi V et al. 2021; Campbell GR et al. 2021). Second, SARS-CoV-2 dsRNA replication intermediates can be recognized by cytoplasmic receptors DDX58 and IFIH1 which bind to mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS, IPS-1) to induce the IFN-mediated antiviral response (Rebendenne A et al. 2021; Yin X et al. 2021). In addition, SARS-CoV-2 E can be sensed by TLR2 (Zheng M et al. 2021). Further, cellular nucleic acid-binding protein (CNBP) and La-related protein 1 (LARP1) can directly bind SARS-CoV-2 gRNA to repress SARS-CoV-2 replication (Schmidt N et al. 2021). This module also describes several strategies developed by SARS-CoV-2 to evade or alter host immunity, including escaping innate immune sensors, inhibiting IFN production and signaling, and evading antiviral function of IFN stimulated gene (ISG) products. For example, SARS-CoV-2 encodes nsp14 and nsp16 which possess guanine-N7-methyltransferase activity and 2\u2019-O-methyl-transferase activity respectively (Ogando NS et al. 2020; Krafcikova P et al. 2020; Viswanatha T et al. 2020; Lin S et al. 2021; Yan L et al. 2021). In human coronaviruses nsp14 generates 5' cap-0 viral RNA (m7GpppN, guanine N7-methylated) and nsp16 further methylates cap-0 viral RNA. These viral RNA modifications mimic the 5'-cap structure of host mRNAs allowing the virus to efficiently evade recognition by cytosolic DDX58 and IFIH1 (Chen Y et al. 2009, 2011; Daffis S et al. 2010, shown for CoVs such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV). Structural studies and computational analysis suggest that properties and biological functions of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 and nsp16 could be very similar to these of SARS-CoV-1 (Rosas-Lemus M et al. 2020; Lin S et al. 2020; Viswanathan T et al. 2020; Krafcikova P et al. 2020; Jiang Y et al. 2020; Wilamowski M et al. 2021). Further, the uridylate\u2010specific endoribonuclease (EndoU) activity of SARS-CoV-2 nsp15 degrades viral RNA to hide it from innate immune sensors (Frazier MN et al. 2021). Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 encodes several proteins that directly bind to host targets associated with SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 infection and cytokine production (Shin D et al. 2020; Viswanathan T et al. 2020; Xia H et al. 2020; Matsuyama T et al. 2020; Yuen CK et al. 2020; reviewed by Park A & Iwasaki A 2020). This Reactome module describes several such binding events and their consequences. For example, as a deubiquitinating and deISGylating enzyme, viral nsp3 binds to and removes ISG15 from signaling proteins such as IRF3 and IFIH1 thereby modulating the formation of signaling complexes and the activation of IRF3/7 and NF-kappaB (Liu CQ et al. 2021). Binding of SARS-CoV-2 nsp6, nsp13 or membrane (M) protein to cytosolic TBK1 prevents IRF3/7 activation and inhibits IFN production downstream of DDX58, IFIH1, MAVS and STING signaling pathways (Xia H et al. 2020; Sui L et al. 2021). Next, M protein targets MAVS to prevent the formation of the MAVS signalosome complex and thereby inhibits downstream signaling pathways of DDX58 and IFIH1 (Fu YZ et al. 2021). Binding of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein to E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 inhibits TRIM25-mediated DDX58 ubiquitination and the DDX58 signaling pathway (Gori SG et al. 2021). N interacts with NLRP3 to promote the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Pan P et al. 2021). The interaction between viral N and MASP2 promotes MASP2-mediated cleavage of C4 (Ali YM et al. 2021) and C2 (Kang S et al. 2021) leading to the hyperactivation of the complement system. Besides, viral N promotes NF-kappaB activation by targeting signaling complexes of TAK1 and IKK (Wu Y et al. 2021). The ion channel activities of accessory protein ORF3a or 3a (open reading frame 3a) and SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 envelope (E) protein contribute to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome leading to highly inflammatory pyroptotic cell death (based on findings for SARS-CoV-1, Siu KL et al. 2019). SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 protease (3CLpro) cleaves TAB1, a component of the TAK1 complex, thus inhibiting NF-kappaB activation (Moustaqil M et al .2021). 3CLpro targets NLRP12 which modulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines through the regulation of the NFkappaB and MAPK pathways (Moustaqil M et al. 2021). SARS-CoV-2 6 (ORF6) interacts with importin KPNA2 and components of the nuclear pore complex, NUP98 and RAE1, to block nuclear translocation of IRF3, STAT1 and STAT2 (Xia H et al. 2020; Miorin L et al. 2020). SARS-CoV-2 9b (ORF9b) inhibits the MAVS-mediated production of type I IFNs by targeting TOMM70 on the mitochondria (Jiang HW et al. 2020). Binding of mitochondrial viral 9 to IKBKG prevents MAVS-dependent NF-kappaB activation (Wu J et al. 2021). Although the evasion mechanisms are mainly conserved between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 (Gordon DE et al. 2020), studies identified SARS-CoV-2-specific modulations of host immune response that may contribute to pathophysiological determinants of COVID-19 (Gordon DE et al. 2020; Schiller HB et al. 2021). This Reactome module describes several virus-host interactions identified in cells during SARS-CoV-2, but not SARS-CoV-1, infection. For example, SARS-CoV-2 8 (ORF8) regulates the expression of class I MHC on the surface of the infected cells through an autophagy-dependent lysosomal degradation of class I MHC (Zhang Y et al. 2021). At the plasma membrane, binding of secreted viral 8 to IL17RA activates IL17 signaling pathway leading to an increased secretion of cytokines/chemokines thus contributing to cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection (Lin X et al. 2021). Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2-host interactome and proteomics studies identified various human proteins that are targeted by SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Gordon DE et al. 2020a, b; Bojkova D et al. 2020; Stukalov A et al. 2021; Li J et al. 2021; Messina F et al. 2021). This Reactome module does not cover all identified SARS-CoV-2\u2013human interactions; the module describes those associations that were functionally validated.

Pathogens evolved various strategies to manipulate autophagy responses. This Reactome module describes the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on autophagy. SARS-CoV-2-encoded proteins, such as open reading frame 3a (ORF3a, 3a) and ORF7a (7a), were shown to colocalize with markers of late endosomal membrane, lysosomal membrane and trans-Golgi network (Hayn M et al. 2021; Koepke L et al. 2021; Zhang Y et al. 2021). Both 3a and 7a block autophagic flux in human cells, but use different strategies (Hayn M et al. 2021; Koepke L et al. 2021). While 7a lowers the acidity of lysosome (Koepke L et al. 2021), ORF3a prevents autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Zhang Y et al. 2021; Qu Y et al. 2021; Miao G et al. 2021). Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 infection stimulates autophagy and leads to an accumulation of autophagosomes but blocks fusion between autophagosome and lysosome thereby preventing degradation of the cargo. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 membrane (M) protein associates with the mitochondrion to promote mitophagy (Hui X et al. 2021).", "isDisease": true}, {"dbId": "9755779", "stId": "R-HSA-9755779", "id": "R-HSA-9755779", "name": "SARS-CoV-2 targets host intracellular signalling and regulatory pathways", "exactType": "Pathway", "species": ["Homo sapiens"], "summation": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS\u2011CoV\u20112) encodes several proteins that modulate host intracellular signaling and regulatory pathways.

This Reactome module describes several such binding events and their consequences. First, SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 M binds to 3\u2011phosphoinositide\u2011dependent protein kinase 1 (PDPK1) to inhibit PKB/Akt activation (Ren Y et al. 2021). Second, SARS\u2011CoV\u20111 N binds to the host 14-3-3 protein, which regulates nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and other functions of N (Tugaeva KV et al. 2021).

Proteins containing PDZ domains are typically found in the cell cytoplasm or in association with the plasma membrane and play a role in a variety of cellular processes such as cell-cell junctions, cellular polarity, and signal transduction pathways. The multidomain structure of PDZ-containing proteins enables them to interact with multiple binding partners simultaneously, thereby assembling larger protein complexes (Harris BZ & Lim WA 2001). Viruses also encode PBM-containing proteins that bind to cellular PDZ proteins. Viral PBMs target cellular PDZ-containing proteins involved in tight junction formation, cell polarity establishment, and apoptosis (Javier RT & Rice AP 2011).", "isDisease": true}, {"dbId": "9772573", "stId": "R-HSA-9772573", "id": "R-HSA-9772573", "name": "Late SARS-CoV-2 Infection Events", "exactType": "Pathway", "species": ["Homo sapiens"], "summation": "The coronavirus virion consists of structural proteins, namely spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and, for some betacoronaviruses, haemagglutinin-esterase. The positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome (+ssRNA) is encapsidated by N, whereas M and E ensure its incorporation in the viral particle during the assembly process. S trimers protrude from the host-derived viral envelope and provide specificity for cellular entry receptors. SARS-CoV-2 particles bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cellular receptors and together with host factors (such as the cell surface serine protease TMPRSS2), promote viral uptake and fusion at the cellular or endosomal membrane.  Following entry, the release and uncoating of the incoming genomic RNA subject it to the immediate translation of two large open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b.  ORF1a and ORF1b encode 1516 non-structural proteins (nsp), of which 15 compose the viral replication and transcription complex (RTC) that includes, amongst others, RNA-processing and RNA-modifying enzymes and an RNA proofreading function necessary for maintaining the integrity of the >30kb coronavirus genome. ORFs that encode structural proteins and interspersed ORFs that encode accessory proteins are transcribed from the 3' one-third of the genome to form a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs (sg mRNAs).  The resulting polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab are co-translationally and post-translationally processed into the individual non-structural proteins (nsps) that form the viral replication and transcription complex. Concordant with the expression of nsps, the biogenesis of viral replication organelles consisting of characteristic perinuclear double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), convoluted membranes (CMs) and small open double-membrane spherules (DMSs) create a protective microenvironment for viral genomic RNA replication and transcription of subgenomic mRNAs comprising the characteristic nested set of coronavirus mRNAs.  Translated structural proteins translocate into endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes and transit through the ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), where interaction with N-encapsidated, newly produced genomic RNA results in budding into the lumen of secretory vesicular compartments. Finally, virions are secreted from the infected cell by exocytosis.  A successful intracellular coronavirus life cycle invariably relies on critical molecular interactions with host proteins that are repurposed to support the requirements of the virus. This includes host factors required for virus entry (such as the entry receptor and host cell proteases), factors required for viral RNA synthesis and virus assembly (such as ER and Golgi components and associated vesicular trafficking pathways) and factors required for the translation of viral mRNAs (such as critical translational initiation factors)", "isDisease": true}, {"dbId": "9694322", "stId": "R-HSA-9694322", "id": "R-HSA-9694322", "name": "Virion Assembly and Release", "exactType": "Pathway", "species": ["Homo sapiens"], "summation": "This COVID-19 pathway has been created by a combination of computational inference from SARS-CoV-1 data (https://reactome.org/documentation/inferred-events) and manual curation, as described in the summation for the overall SARS-CoV-2 infection pathway.<br><br>The structures of complete SARS-CoV-2 virions, as well as their assembly stages, have been elucidated in great detail by cryo-electron microscopy methods. In particular, the Spike trimer is localized to ERGIC or Golgi compartments upon coexpression of E or M, which prevents syncytia formation (Boson et al, 2020). It is then transported via small transport vesicles to assembly sites (Klein et al, 2020; Mendon\u00e7a et al, 2021; reviewed by Hardenbrook and Zhang, 2021).\n\nBased on work done in related coronaviruses, viral assembly is expected to occur at the ERGIC membrane (reviewed in Masters, 2006; Fehr and Perlman, 2015; Fung and Liu, 2019). Membrane protein components of the virus concentrate at the ERGIC membrane but are also found throughout the secretory system including at the plasma membrane. Accumulation at the site of viral assembly has been shown to depend on interaction between retrieval signals in the cytoplasmic tails of viral proteins and host factors such as the COPI coat, and likely involves repeated rounds of anterograde and retrograde traffic (McBride et al, 2007; Ujike et al, 2016; Tan et al, 2004; Tan et al, 2005; reviewed in McBride and Fielding, 2012; Chang et al, 2014).<br>Viral assembly is initiated by homotypic interactions of M protein (Tseng et al, 2010; Siu et al, 2008). This forms an M-lattice that contributes to the induction of membrane curvature and additionally acts as a scaffold for the recruitment of the other structural components of the virus (Voss et al, 2009). M protein makes interactions with each of the main components of the mature virus, including E, S and N (He et al, 2004; Luo et al, 2006; Siu et al, 2008; reviewed in Masters, 2006). Electron micrographic studies suggest the final size of the mature virus is ~100 nm. The ribonuclear particle is predominantly helical and is packaged with an outer diamter of ~ 16 nm (Neuman et al, 2006; Neuman et al, 2011; reviewed in Chang et al, 2014). These physical constraints suggest a final stoichiometry in the mature virion of 75 S trimers:1200 M proteins:300 N:1 RNA genome (Neuman et al, 2011; reviewed in Chang et al, 2014).

The membrane fusion that drives these cell-cell fusion events are caused by the same machinery that underlies viral entry. The presence of infected syncytial pneumocytes in severe COVID-19 patients is well established (Zhang et al., 2021). However, it is currently unclear if syncytia formation is also a feature of milder or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. These syncytia are also thought to facilitate replication and evasion of the host immune response (for a recent review on Spike-mediated fusion and syncytia formation see Rajah et al, 2022). Experiments that utilize co-cultures of human cells expressing the receptor ACE2 with cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, result in synapse-like intercellular contacts that initiate cell-cell fusion, producing syncytia resembling those we identify in lungs of COVID-19 patients (Sanders et al., 2021). Studies on SARS-CoV-2 identified similar syncytia (Buchrieser et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020a; Ou et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2020). Formation of the ACE2/spike protein complex drives fusion events that proceed from finger-like projections, forming synapses between cells to development of a fusion pore and subsequent membrane fusion (reviewed in Rajah et al, 2022; Rey, 2021).

Although there is no reason for the host's glycosylation enzymes behaving differently than with other host or non-host proteins, direct involvement of host enzymes and chaperones with SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycosylation has not been shown.

The expression and tissue distribution of entry receptors consequently influence viral tropism and pathogenicity. Besides receptor binding, the proteolytic cleavage of coronavirus S proteins by host cell-derived proteases is essential to permit fusion. SARS-CoV has been shown to use the cell-surface serine protease TMPRSS2 for priming and entry, although the endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B (CatB) and CatL can also assist in this process. During the intracellular life cycle SARS-CoV-2 express and replicate their genomic RNA to produce full-length copies that are incorporated into newly produced viral particles. Coronaviruses possess remarkably large RNA genomes flanked by 5' and 3' untranslated regions that contain cis-acting secondary RNA structures essential for RNA synthesis. At the 5' end, the genomic RNA features two large open reading frames (ORFs; ORF1a and ORF1b) that occupy two-thirds of the capped and polyadenylated genome.  Coronavirus S proteins are homotrimeric class I fusion glycoproteins that are divided into two functionally distinct parts (S1 and S2). The surface-exposed S1 contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that specifically engages the host cell receptor, thereby determining virus cell tropism and pathogenicity.

ORF1a and ORF1b encode 15-16 non-structural proteins (nsp), of which 15 compose the viral replication and transcription complex (RTC) that includes, amongst others, RNA-processing and RNA-modifying enzymes and an RNA proofreading function necessary for maintaining the integrity of the >30kb coronavirus genome.

Specific interaction between S1 and the cognate receptor triggers a drastic conformational change in S2, leading to fusion between the virus envelope and the cellular membrane and release of the viral nucleocapsid into the host cell cytosol. Receptor binding is the major determinant of the host range and tissue tropism for a coronavirus. Some human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have adopted cell surface enzymes as receptors, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV-2 (reviewed by Jackson et al, 2022), SARS-CoV-1, and HCoV NL63.

The polymerase can also switch template during discontinuous transcription of the genome at specific sites called transcription-regulated sequences, thereby producing a 5'-nested set of negative-sense sgRNAs, which are used as templates for the synthesis of a 3'-nested set of positive-sense sgRNAs (Masters 2006). Although genome replication/transcription is mainly mediated by the viral replicase and confines in the RTC, the involvement of various additional viral and host factors has been implicated. For instance, coronavirus N protein is known to serve as an RNA chaperone and facilitate template switching (Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al. 2007, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al. 2010). Importantly, the N protein of SARS-CoV-1 and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-JHM) is also phosphorylated by the host glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), and inhibition of GSK3 was shown to inhibit viral replication in Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-1 (Wu et al. 2009). Additionally, GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of the MHV-JHM N protein recruits an RNA-binding protein DEAD-box helicase 1 (DDX1), which facilitates template read-through, favoring the synthesis of genomic RNA and longer sgRNAs (Wu et al. 2014). Another RNA-binding protein called heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1) can also bind tightly to SARS-CoV-1 N protein and potentially regulate viral RNA synthesis (Luo et al. 2005). Host RNA-binding proteins could also bind directly to untranslated regions (UTRs) of the coronavirus genome to modulate replication/transcription, such as zinc finger CCHC-type and RNA-binding motif 1 (ZCRB1) binding to the 5-UTR of IBV (Tan et al. 2012), mitochondrial aconitase binding to the 3' UTR of MHV (Nanda and Leibowitz 2001), and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) to the poly(A) tail of bovine coronavirus (Spagnolo and Hogue 2000).

Remaining steps have been inferred from previous studies in SARS\u2011CoV\u20111 and related coronaviruses.<br><br>SARS-CoV-1 encodes eight subgenomic RNAs, mRNA2 to mRNA9. mRNA1 corresponds to the genomic RNA. The 5' and 3' ends of subgenomic RNAs are identical, in accordance with the template switch model of coronavirus RNA transcription (Snijder et al. 2003, Thiel et al. 2003, Yount et al. 2003). Genomic positive strand RNA is first transcribed into negative sense (minus strand) subgenomic mRNAs by template switching. Negative sense mRNAs subsequently serve as templates for the synthesis of positive strand subgenomic mRNAs. As shown in murine hepatitis virus (MHV), which is closely related to SARS-CoV-1, negative-sense viral RNAs are present in much smaller amounts than positive-sense RNAs (Irigoyen et al. 2016). Of the eight subgenomic mRNAs of SARS-CoV-1, mRNA2 encodes the S protein, mRNA3 is bicistronic and encodes proteins 3a and 3b, mRNA4 encodes the E protein, mRNA5 encodes the M protein, mRNA6 encodes protein 6, and bicistronic mRNA7, mRNA8 and mRNA9 encode proteins 7a and 7b (mRNA7), 8a and 8b (mRNA8), and 9a and N (mRNA9), respectively (Snijder et al. 2003, Thiel et al. 2003, Yount et al. 2003). The template switch model of coronavirus involves discontinuous transcription of subgenomic RNA, with the leader body joining occurring during the synthesis of minus strand RNAs. Each subgenomic RNA contains a leader transcription regulatory sequence (leader TRS) that is identical to the leader of the genome, appended via polymerase \u201cjumping\u201d during negative strand synthesis to the body transcription regulatory sequence (body TRS), a short, AU-rich motif of about 10 nucleotides found upstream of each ORF that is destined to become 5' proximal in one of the subgenomic mRNAs. The 3' and 5'UTRs may interact through RNA\u2013RNA and/or RNA\u2013protein plus protein\u2013protein interactions to promote circularization of the coronavirus genome, placing the elongating minus strand in a favorable topology for leader-body joining. The host protein PABP was found to bind to the coronavirus 3' poly(A) tail and to interact with the host protein eIF-4G, a component of the three-subunit complex that binds to mRNA cap structures, which may promote the circularization of the coronavirus genome. Two viral proteins that bind to the coronavirus 5'UTR, the N protein and nsp1, may play a role in template switching. The poly(A) tail is necessary for the initiation of minus-strand RNA synthesis at the 3' end of genomic RNA.  Elongation of nascent minus strand RNA continues until the first functional body TRS motif is encountered. A fixed proportion of replication-transcription complexes (RTCs) will either disregard the TRS motif and continue to elongate the nascent strand or stop synthesis of the nascent minus strand and relocate to the leader TRS, extending the minus strand by copying the 5' end of the genome. The completed minus-strand RNAs then serve as templates for positive strand mRNA synthesis (reviewed by Sawicki et al. 2007, Yang and Leibowitz 2015).", "isDisease": true}, {"dbId": "9694686", "stId": "R-HSA-9694686", "id": "R-HSA-9694686", "name": "Replication of the SARS-CoV-2 genome", "exactType": "Pathway", "species": ["Homo sapiens"], "summation": "This COVID-19 pathway has been created by a combination of computational inference from SARS-CoV-1 data (https://reactome.org/documentation/inferred-events) and manual curation, as described in the summation for the overall SARS-CoV-2 infection pathway.
